# README

This is a trial and error game where the user needs to move around and try
many different ways to complete the required tasks until they figure it out.
For the purpose of grading, I am providing the best sequence to complete the game:

* In WaitingRoom press 3 to go to Photo Lab
* In Photo Lab press y to receive photo
* Press 2 to go to Forms Dept
* In Forms Dept press 2 to request Form 57b
* Press 3 to go to Vision Test and complete task
* Press 5 to go to Written Test, go to any room and back to WT if test fails
* Press 2 to go back to Forms Dept
* Press 2 to request Form 409H
* Press 1 to go to Driving Test and complete driving task
* Press 1 to go back to Forms Dept
* Press 3 to request form 90A
* Press 4 to go back to Waiting Room and receive license

Note: to test only the Driving Test part of the game, there is a secret option #6 in
the navigation menu that fills all the requirements in the inventory and takes the
player to the Driving Test Rooom.
