# Lab 08

This lab demonstrates a queue abstract data type, using a doubly-linked circular structure.

## Installation

Run the terminal command `make` from the directory where all the files were unzipped

## Usage

To run the program, run the `./queue` command from the terminal. A menu will come up
asking which operation you would like to test on the queue:

a. Add a value to the queue
  - asks for the value to add and appends it to the back of the queue
b. Display first node (front) value
c. Remove first node (front) value
d. Display the queue contents
x. Exit

As many operations as desired can be performed on the queue, before selecting x to exit

To clean up the directory and remove all object files and executables, run the `make clean` command in the terminal
